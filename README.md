# Strelka
Strelka is a real-time file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. Based on the design established by Lockheed Martin's [Laika BOSS](https://github.com/lmco/laikaboss) and similar projects (see: [related projects](#related-projects)), Strelka's purpose is to perform file extraction and metadata collection at huge scale.

This is an experimental branch that uses gRPC instead of ZeroMQ for network communication!

## Licensing
Strelka and its associated code is released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.
